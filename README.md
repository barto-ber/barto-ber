### Hi there!!! ðŸ˜„


Iâ€™m Bart and Iâ€™m a Data Scientist with over âš¡15 years' experience in finance. 

A few things about me, I wrote my first code in Python to automate some financial reporting in my day-to-day job and got excited about Python and later Data Science so I know how to solve problems by my own using research and new technologies. On the technical side, during my data science studies I built few nice end-to-end Machine Learning Web Apps with django and deployment on Heroku in connection to AWS ([link](https://github.com/barto-ber/Machine-Learning-Projects)). I also started a project for analyzing an accountancy system with Machine Learning i.e. outliers detection as well as built a web scraper for a web radio I like.

In addition, Iâ€™m obsessed with digging deeper into Big Data. As a result, Iâ€™m currently learning some technologies like Apache Spark and Airflow to build an app with streaming data. I just finished a Big Data project with Kafka & Spark Structured Streaming for Sentiment Analysis ([link](https://github.com/barto-ber/Big-Data-Projects/tree/master/Structured%20Streaming%20Project)) and I found it fantastic.


So guess, Iâ€™m looking for a junior position in Data Science and would be happy if you are looking for somebody like meðŸ‘¯!


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on improvement of my Data Science % Machine Learning skills.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Apache Spark, Kafka.
