### Hi there!!!


I am an outcome-driven professional with nearly 20 years of international experience in finance, controlling, financial systems and data science. 

As a professional in finance, which is also based on data, and including my earlier studies of economics and statistics, I decided to extend my knowledge and dive into data science. I further developed my knowledge on statistics, learned Python and its most common data scientific libraries, studied machine learning and finished some interesting projects (see GitHub). This journey opened up my mind to new horizons and provided me with a fresh perspective on classical finance.

In addition to that, I have good skills in complex data manipulation, cleaning and exploratory analysis. I gained first experiences in successfully building complete machine learning projects. Moreover, I am fascinated by combining IT & business knowledge, promoting and supporting automation and data science.

Furthermore, I have established financial departments from scratch, including: accountancy, controlling and reporting, creating efficient finance systems & infrastructure, focusing on eliminating manual work at every finance area using modern apps and own coding skills.
